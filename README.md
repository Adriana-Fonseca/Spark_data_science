The aim of this project is to analyse whether we can use data about methylation frequency to predict whether a person will get acute myeloid leaukemia (AML).

We are looking at 23 donors who go on to develop AML in the next two years, and matched controls. We have data for around 2500 informative differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (defined in previous work).

We also have data on age and smoking status, so will also query whether the DMRs allow prediction of these factors (as there is a correlation between methylation and each of these).
